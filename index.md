# Hello World

## My name is Carter Moynihan. I love Minecraft.

## I also love coding, science and math.

I think that the dragon egg in Minecraft should have a use in game because it currently does nothing. I think it could be used to get special armour or weapons because it is a drop from one of the hardest bosses in game. The same is true of the nether star-- yes i know it does have a use but i feel it needs to have a part in some new armour and weapons.

I also think Minecraft should add some new ores that may be better then diamonds like for example they can add in ruby or amethyst. Also to go with better armour and weapons, Minecraft should add new bosses like a new dragon (fire and ice dragons) you can tame and have as pets.
